# RiftBets-iOS
An iPhone client built to consume the RiftBets RESTful JSON API. The application is written in Swift 2.3 with the Facebook, Bolts, and Fabric SDK. 
We are using cocoapods v1.1.1 for our package manger to community code packages from GitHub and other sources. We save user state to the iCloud Keychain and use Alamofire v3 to send our HTTP requests to our API.
