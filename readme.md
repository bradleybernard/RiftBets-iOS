# RiftBets-iOS
An iPhone client built to consume the RiftBets RESTful JSON API. The application is written in Swift 2.3 with the Facebook and Fabric SDKs. 
We are using CocoaPods v1.1.1 for our package manger to pull in open source libraries to use in our app. We save user state to the iCloud Keychain and use Alamofire v3 to send HTTP requests to our custom API.
